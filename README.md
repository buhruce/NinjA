I created this project as an excuse to try out GitHub Actions. My previous/current places of employment have used Jenkins or other CI/CD tooling.

NinjA is an API scraper for a browser-based game I have been playing on and off since the late 90s. There have been many community projects over the years performing simliar tasks. The benefits of this project is it costs 0 dollars and requires 0 infrastructure.
